## Welcome to my GitHub!ðŸ‘‹I'm Kaninika Das, exploring the world of Full Stack Development. Always eager to learn and build!

**daskani/daskani** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a dynamic and responsive registration form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery for  enhanced interactivity). I'm focusing on client-side validation and a clean user interface.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning backend development with PHP, understanding server-side logic, database interactions (like setting up a MySQL connection), and API creation. I'm excited to connect my front-end forms to a working backend!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on small web projects that involve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery, especially if they have a simple backend component where I can apply my new PHP knowledge.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with best practices for securing PHP applications and handling database connections securely.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about frontend web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including jQuery) or getting started with basic responsive design.
